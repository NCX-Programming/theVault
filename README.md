# theVault
### The greatest jumble of cross-platform C# shenanigans around.
And yes, cross platform. All projects contained in theVault are guarenteed to work on x64 Windows and Linux (and possbily macOS but I don't have a way to test that.)
## Compiling and Running
Since theVault doesn't have releases, you'll need to compile the programs youself. Don't worry, it's easy!

### Before starting, make sure you have latest version of the .NET Core **SDK** installed!
Not the runtime, because you need the SDK to compile the apps. All Vault apps require .NET 5.0.

### Windows, Linux, and macOS
1. Download the source code using your favorite method. (Whether that be HTTPS, SSH, or by using the GitHub CLI)
2. Open a terminal or command promt and enter the folder for the program you wish to run
3. Type `dotnet run` into your terminal or command prompt
4. And you're off! After a few moments it should finish compiling and run

### Windows (Alternate)
Alternatively, you could compile the programs using Visual Studio 2019. (Note that this is not the recommended method)
1. Download the source code using your favorite method. (Whether that be HTTPS, SSH, or by using the GitHub CLI)
2. Open the `theVault` folder in Visual Studio 2019
3. The rest of this part is coming soon.


This README will be improved soon.
