# theVault
### The greatest jumble of cross-platform C# shenanigans around.
And yes, cross platform. All projects contained in theVault are guarenteed to work on x64 Windows and Linux, possbily macOS but I don't have a way to test that.
To run the programs, just download the projects, enter the project folder you want to run, and then type `dotnet run`. It will then compile and run.
This README will be improved soon.
